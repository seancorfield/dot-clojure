# dot-clojure

This is my personal `.clojure/deps.edn` file providing useful `clj` aliases drawn from a variety of projects. It is published to GitHub so I can keep all my computers sync'd up -- and to provide a range of examples that folks new to the Clojure CLI might find helpful.

**Several git dependencies here assume you have at least Clojure CLI 1.11.1.1273!**

In addition, my `.clojure/tools/` folder is also here, containing the tools that I've installed globally, via the latest Clojure CLI (was 1.11.1.1273 when I last updated this) -- see [Tool installation and invocation](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli#tool_install) in the Deps and CLI Reference. As I add global tools, I am removing them as aliases.

The main alias I use here is `:dev/repl` which starts various combinations of REPL tooling. See [**The `:dev/repl` Alias**](#the-devrepl-alias) below for more details.

_Since it is my personal file, it may make assumptions about my own environment. For example, it uses `"RELEASE"` for several tools so I can always get the latest stable version of any dev/test tool I use. I make no effort at backward-compatibility and may add, delete, or change aliases as they benefit me personally. Caveat Programmer!_

**If you want a really well-documented, well-maintained alternative that actually tracks versions of tools, I would recommend you use the [Practicalli Clojure `deps.edn`](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-deps-edn) project instead!**

With that caveat out of the way, here is some basic documentation about my tools and aliases (there are additional examples in the comments in the `deps.edn` file itself). _Note: I have recently cleaned this file up and removed a lot of aliases I no longer use!_

TL;DR: add the following dependency and then start a REPL with `clj -M:dev/repl` (optionally with other aliases to bring in more tooling):

```clojure
:aliases
{:dev/repl
 {:extra-deps
  {io.github.seancorfield/dot-clojure
   {:git/tag "v1.0.2"
    :git/sha "6a3f903"}}
  :main-opts ["-e" "((requiring-resolve 'org.corfield.dev.repl/start-repl))"]}}
```

## Basic Tools

These are installed via `clojure -Ttools install ...` and usable via `clojure -T` with the tool name.

* `antq` -- the outdated dependencies checker:
  * `clojure -Tantq outdated` -- check the current project's dependencies,
  * `clojure -A:deps -Tantq help/doc` -- for more information and other functions.
* `clj-watson` -- a software composition analysis scanner, based on the National Vulnerability Database: [clj-watson](https://github.com/clj-holmes/clj-watson)
  * `clojure -Tclj-watson scan :deps-edn-path '"deps.edn"' :output '"stdout"'`
* `new` -- the latest version of [deps-new](https://github.com/seancorfield/deps-new) to create new CLI/`deps.edn` projects: _[This uses a different (simpler!) templating system to `clj-new`, below, and therefore does not recognize Leiningen or Boot templates!]_
  * `clojure -Tnew app :name myname/myapp` -- creates a new `deps.edn`-based application project,
  * `clojure -Tnew lib :name myname/mylib` -- creates a new `deps.edn`-based library project,
  * `clojure -Tnew template :name myname/mytemplate` -- creates a new `deps.edn`-based template project,
  * `clojure -A:somealias -Tnew create :template some/thing :name myname/myapp` -- locates a template for `some/thing` on the classpath, based on `:somealias`, and uses it to create a new `deps.edn`-based project,
  * `clojure -A:deps -Tnew help/doc` -- for more information and other functions.
* `poly` -- a recent **master** version of [Polylith's `poly` tool](https://github.com/polyfy/polylith) for working with Polylith projects:
  * `clojure -Tpoly shell` -- start an interactive Polylith shell,
  * `clojure -Tpoly info :loc true` -- display information about a Polylith workspace, including lines of code,
  * `clojure -Tpoly create c user` -- create a `user` component in a Polylith workspace,
  * `clojure -Tpoly test :dev true` -- run tests in the `dev` project context, in a Polylith workspace,
  * `clojure -A:deps -Tpoly help/doc` -- for more information and other functions.

And the older `clj-new` tool:

* `clj-new` -- the latest stable release of [clj-new](https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-new) to create new projects from (Leiningen and other) templates:
  * `clojure -Tclj-new app :name myname/myapp` -- creates a new `deps.edn`-based application project (using `tools.build` for the uberjar),
  * `clojure -Tclj-new lib :name myname/mylib` -- creates a new `deps.edn`-based library project (using `tools.build` for the jar),
  * `clojure -Tclj-new template :name myname/mytemplate` -- creates a new `deps.edn`-based template project (using `tools.build` for the jar),
  * `clojure -Tclj-new create :template something :name myname/myapp` -- locates a template for `something` and uses it to create a new project (which might be `deps.edn`-based or `lein`-based, depending on the template),
  * `clojure -A:deps -Tclj-new help/doc` -- for more information and other functions.

More tools will be added to this section over time (as more tools add `:tools/usage` to their `deps.edn` files).

## Basic Aliases

Deploy jar files (if you don't have a `build.clj` file):
* `:deploy` -- pulls in and runs the latest stable release of Erik Assum's [deps-deploy](https://github.com/slipset/deps-deploy) and deploys the specified JAR file to Clojars, based on your `pom.xml` and the `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD` environment variables; `clojure -X:deploy :artifact '"MyProject.jar"'`

There are aliases to pull in various useful testing and debugging tools:
* `:test` -- adds both `test` and `src/test/clojure` to your classpath and pulls in the latest stable version of `test.check`
* `:runner` -- pulls in [Cognitect Labs' `test-runner`](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/test-runner) project and runs any tests it can find
* `:eastwood` -- pulls in the latest stable release of [Eastwood](https://github.com/jonase/eastwood) on your `src` and `test` folders; use with `:test` above
* `:check` -- pulls in [Athos' Check](https://github.com/athos/clj-check) project to compile all your namespaces to check for syntax errors and reflection warnings like `lein check`
* `:expect` -- pulls in the latest stable release of [expectations/clojure-test](https://github.com/clojure-expectations/clojure-test) -- the `clojure.test`-compatible version of Expectations
* `:bench` -- pulls in the latest stable release of [Criterium](https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium/) for benchmarking your code

There are aliases to pull in and start various REPL-related tools:
* `:dev/repl` -- depending on what is on your classpath, start Rebel Readline, with a Socket REPL (if requested -- note that "port 0" will dynamically select an available port and print it out), but `SOCKET_REPL_PORT` env var and `socket-repl-port` property override, saves port to `.socket-repl-port` file for next time;
  * usage:
    * `clj -M:portal:dev/repl` -- basic REPL with Portal or
    * `clojure -M:rebel:dev/repl` -- Rebel Readline REPL or
    * `clojure -M:rebel:portal:dev/repl` -- ...with Portal or
    * `clojure -M:nrepl:dev/repl` -- basic nREPL server or
    * `clojure -M:nrepl:portal:dev/repl` -- basic nREPL server with Portal middleware or
    * `clojure -M:cider-nrepl:dev/repl` -- CIDER nREPL server or
    * `clojure -M:cider-nrepl:portal:dev/repl` -- CIDER nREPL server with Portal middleware or
  * Also works with Figwheel Main (now that I've started doing ClojureScript!):
    * `clojure -M:portal:fig:build:dev/repl` or
* `:classes` -- adds the `classes` folder to your classpath to pick up compiled code (e.g., see https://clojure.org/guides/dev_startup_time)
* `:socket` -- starts a Socket REPL on port 50505; can be combined with other aliases since this is just a JVM option
* `:rebel` -- starts a [Rebel Readline](https://github.com/bhauman/rebel-readline) REPL
* `:nrepl` -- starts a (headless) [nREPL server](https://nrepl.org/) on a random available port; `clojure -M:nrepl`
* `:cider-nrepl` -- starts a (headless) CIDER-enhanced [nREPL server](https://nrepl.org/) on a random available port; `clojure -M:cider-nrepl`

* `:datomic/dev.datafy` -- adds `datafy`/`nav` support for Datomic objects via [datomic/dev.datafy](https://github.com/Datomic/dev.datafy)
* `:dbxray` -- adds [donut-party/dbxray](https://github.com/donut-party/dbxray) to help visualize your database structure
* `:jedi-time` -- adds `datafy`/`nav` support for Java Time objects via [jedi-time](https://github.com/jimpil/jedi-time)
* `:portal` -- pulls in the latest stable release of the [Portal](https://github.com/djblue/portal) data visualization tool -- see the Portal web site for usage options
* `:reflect` -- adds Stuart Halloway's reflector utility (best used with Portal)

There are aliases to pull in specific versions of Clojure:
* `:master` -- Clojure 1.12.0-master-SNAPSHOT
* `:1.12` -- Clojure 1.12.0-alpha4
* `:1.11` -- Clojure 1.11.1 -- see [changes to Clojure in version 1.11.1](https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/changes.md)
  * `:1.11.0` -- Clojure 1.11.0
* `:1.10` -- Clojure 1.10.3
  * `:1.10.2` -- Clojure 1.10.2
  * `:1.10.1` -- Clojure 1.10.1
  * `:1.10.0` -- Clojure 1.10.0
* `:1.9` -- Clojure 1.9.0
* `:1.8` -- Clojure 1.8.0
* ... back to `:1.0` (note: `:1.5` is actually Clojure 1.5.1 to avoid a bug in Clojure 1.5.0, and `:1.2` is 1.2.1)

> Note: the _EXPERIMENTAL_ `:add-libs` alias has been removed -- use the [`clojure.repl.deps`](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/branch-master/clojure.repl-api.html#clojure.repl.deps) in Clojure 1.12.0 Alpha 2 or later instead!

## The `:dev/repl` Alias

The `:dev/repl` alias calls `org.corfield.dev.repl/start-repl` in the [`repl.clj` file](https://github.com/seancorfield/dot-clojure/blob/develop/src/org/corfield/dev/repl.clj) from this repo. That does a number of things (see the `start-repl` docstring for more details):

* Optionally, starts a Socket REPL server (with the port selected via an environment variable, a JVM property, or a dot-file created on a previous run).
* If both Portal and `org.clojure/tools.logging` are on the classpath, it patch `tools.logging` to also `tap>` every log message in a format that Portal understands and can display (usually with the ability to go to the file/line listed in the log entry); call `(dev/toggle-logging!)` to turn this `tap>`'ing on and off.
* If Portal 0.33.0 or later is on the classpath, use the Portal middleware with nREPL (if CIDER or nREPL are on the classpath). If using Portal 0.40.0 or later, this also adds the [Portal Notebook middleware](https://cljdoc.org/d/djblue/portal/0.40.0/doc/editors/vs-code/clojure-notebooks#portalnreplwrap-notebook).
* Starts [Figwheel Main](https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main), if present on the classpath, else
* Starts [Rebel Readline](https://github.com/bhauman/rebel-readline), if present on the classpath, else
* Starts a CIDER-enhanced [nREPL Server](https://nrepl.org/), if `cider-nrepl` is present on the classpath, else
* Starts an [nREPL Server](https://nrepl.org/), if present on the classpath.

_Note 1: since the `repl.clj` code uses `requiring-resolve`, it requires at least Clojure 1.10.0!_

_Note 2: if the Portal middleware is added to nREPL/CIDER, all evaluated results will be `tap>`'d (if the Portal UI is open and listening); my [VS Code/Calva setup](https://github.com/seancorfield/vscode-calva-setup) has additional configuration for working with Portal when the middleware is enabled!_

## Use with Figwheel

If you are doing ClojureScript development with Figwheel (`figwheel-main`) then you can do something like:

```
clojure -M:portal:fig:build:dev/repl
```

You'll get the regular Figwheel build REPL (for ClojureScript, which uses Rebel Readline) and a browser open on your application, plus a Socket REPL on an available port (or whatever your env says, for Clojure evaluation).

Connect to the Socket REPL, write your code as `.cljc` files, and you'll have the full power of your editor, Portal, and Figwheel! What you evaluate in your editor will be treated as Clojure code (and can be `tap>`'d into Portal, for example). What you evaluate at the REPL itself will be treated as ClojureScript code (and will affect your application instead).
